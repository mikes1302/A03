  Downloading and installing JetBrains Webstorm on a MAC:
  
    Step 1: Go to the following link: "https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students/" or go to the main Jetbrains website and click on
            Education>Free Licenses then scroll down and click the blue APPLY NOW button. 
          
    Step 2: Fill out the application. You will have to upload proof of verification that you are a student. Store your login information for later use.                 Once your account is approved you will receive an email. Then you can go to the next step. 
 
    Step 3: Go to the main JetBrains website "www.jetbrains.com/" click on the person icon next to the search icon on the upper right corner.
  
    Step 3: Under the text "JetBrains Product Pack for Students" you should see a download button. Click the button and a dropdown will open up. Select the             drop down item "Webstorm". 
  
    Step 4: Once you click "Webstorm" another tab to download should open up. Click on the "MAC" tab and download either the Intel or Apple Silicon                     version. If you are not sure which processor your MAC is running, click the Apple logo on the upper left screen>About This Max and a pop up                 should appear on your screen with computer specification details. Once you have your processor specs, go back to the download page and download             the proper version. Once the download is finished downloading, open it up and let the downloader install Webstorm.
  
    Step 5: Once Webstorm is installed open it up by finding it in the disk you saved it on. You may be prompted to login, use the login from step 2. 
    
    Step 6: Let Webstorm load up and click on the projects tab on the left. Then click the "Get From VCS" tab on the right side. Click on the tab that says             GitHub on the left side and your browser should launch.
    
    Step 7: Click the blue Authorize in GitHub button. You will be prompted to login to your GitHub account that you created in the previous tutorial.
    
    Step 8: After you login, head back to the Webstorm application. Go to the same projects tab before and click the same "Get From VCS" tab, then click               the GitHub tab and all your GitHub roots will pull up. Congratulations you have linked your Webstorm Application and GitHub account!
